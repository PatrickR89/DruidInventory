## DruidInventory

First project with no code to base upon, as it was the case with projects in "100 days of swift". The idea came from my menthor Drago, who provided me with neccesary rules and requests for the applicaton. The app was based on everything I learned in first 10 projects in the course. With some additions like using singletons, creating global variables for some elements like buttons, which are repeated few times in code. Also setting colorscheme using assets, for light and dark mode.
Project included setting up cell identifier as a UITableViewCell extension, to make the code more practical. Alamofire was added with cocoapods for online APIs, connected with CRUD-CRUD, to set up a separate DB. For more detailed info visit me on medium.

Have a nice code read,
Patrick
