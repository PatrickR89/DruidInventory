## DruidInventory

First project from "scratch". The idea came from my mentor, who provided me with neccesary rules and requests for the applicaton. The app was based on everything I learned in first 10 projects in "100 days of Swift" course. With some additions like using singletons, creating global variables for some elements like buttons, which are repeated few times in code. Also setting colorscheme using assets, for light and dark mode.
Project included setting up cell identifier as a UITableViewCell extension, to make the code more practical. Alamofire was added with cocoapods for online APIs, connected with CRUD-CRUD, to set up a separate DB. For more detailed info visit me on medium.
